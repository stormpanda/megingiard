# Megingiard - Technical Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture and key design decisions. Per-feature technical implementation details live in each feature's **`FEATURE.md`** file:

- **[Screen Mirror](features/mirror/FEATURE.md#technical-implementation)** — capture pipeline, `Presentation` window, pan/zoom, freeze
- **[Virtual Touchpad](features/touchpad/FEATURE.md#technical-implementation)** — native binary, event injection, coordinate transformation
- **[Virtual Keyboard](features/keyboard/FEATURE.md#technical-implementation)** — native binary, modifier state machine, key injection, layout system
- **[App Theming](features/theming/FEATURE.md#technical-implementation)** — token-based `AppColors`, dark/light palettes, `LocalAppColors` CompositionLocal

## Dual-Display Layout

Megingiard runs on the AYN Thor, an Android gaming handheld with two physical displays. The app lives on the **secondary (bottom) display** and provides tools that assist the user while the primary (top) display runs games or other applications.

```
Primary Display (DEFAULT_DISPLAY) — top screen, game display
  └─ [running games / other apps — captured by MediaProjection]

Secondary Display (non-default displayId) — bottom screen, Megingiard UI
  ├─ MainActivity → MainAppScreen (Jetpack Compose)
  │    └─ MacroPad-centric main content
  └─ MirrorPresentation (android.app.Presentation — ambient mirroring modes)
       ├─ SurfaceView: hardware VirtualDisplay output (mirrors primary display)
       └─ ComposeView → AmbientMacroPadOverlay / MirrorScreen
```

`MainActivity` and `MainAppScreen` run on the **secondary (bottom) display** (`displayId != Display.DEFAULT_DISPLAY`). `MirrorPresentation` is layered on top of `MainAppScreen` on the same secondary display when ambient mirroring is active and hidden (`hide()`) when it is not needed.

The MacroPad macro editor also uses **inline full-screen overlays in the same secondary-display window** for transient recording workflows. Touch-tap recording opens a dedicated `RecordingMirrorPresentation`, while gamepad macro recording renders an in-app `GamepadRecordingOverlay` directly above `MacroTimelineEditor`. The gamepad overlay intentionally captures input from on-screen touch surfaces instead of listening to the physical controller device, so recording works without root-only device snooping while still forwarding events live through the existing virtual gamepad injector.

### Wrong-Screen Overlay

When `MainActivity` detects that it is running on the **primary display** (`displayId == Display.DEFAULT_DISPLAY`) — either because the app was launched there or moved there at runtime — a global full-screen blocking overlay is shown in `MainAppScreen` on top of all content. The overlay:

- Displays a plain-language message instructing the user to move the app to the bottom screen.
- Shows an animated, vertically bouncing downward arrow (`KeyboardArrowDown`) as a directional hint.
- Consumes all pointer events, preventing interaction with any underlying controls.

Display detection is performed synchronously in `MainActivity`'s Compose tree via `LocalContext.current.display?.displayId` and stored in `AppStateManager.isOnValidScreen`. All capture auto-start paths (`autoStartCapture` on resume, MacroPad ambient auto-trigger) are gated on `isOnValidScreen` to prevent a `MediaProjection` consent dialog from appearing while the app is on the primary display.
