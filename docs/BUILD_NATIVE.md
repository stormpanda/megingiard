# Building the Native Touch Injector

`touchinjector_arm64` is a small C helper binary that writes Linux
`input_event` structs directly to `/dev/input/event6` (the primary
display touchscreen on the AYN Thor). It bypasses the Android input
stack entirely, reducing per-event latency from ~7 ms
(`input motionevent` via Binder IPC) to ~0.37 ms.

The pre-built binary lives at `app/src/main/assets/touchinjector_arm64`.
It is checked in so that a normal Gradle build requires **no NDK
installation**. Rebuild only if you change `touchinjector.c`.

## Source

`app/src/main/cpp/touchinjector.c`

## Prerequisites

| Tool        | Version used          | Notes                           |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Android NDK | **r27c**              | Standalone, not managed by AGP  |
| Host OS     | macOS (darwin-x86_64) | Adjust toolchain path for Linux |

### Download NDK r27c (if not present)

```bash
# macOS
curl -Lo /tmp/ndk.zip \
  https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r27c-darwin.dmg
# … or download the zip variant from developer.android.com/ndk/downloads
```

Or extract the zip into a local folder — only the toolchain directory is needed.

---

## Compile

```bash
NDK=/path/to/android-ndk-r27c
TOOLCHAIN=$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64
SYSROOT=$TOOLCHAIN/sysroot

$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android35-clang \
    --sysroot=$SYSROOT \
    --target=aarch64-linux-android35 \
    -static \
    -O2 \
    -s \
    -o /tmp/touchinjector_arm64 \
    app/src/main/cpp/touchinjector.c
```

For **Linux hosts** replace `darwin-x86_64` with `linux-x86_64` in the
`TOOLCHAIN` path.

---

## Deploy

Copy the compiled binary over the checked-in one:

```bash
cp /tmp/touchinjector_arm64 \
   app/src/main/assets/touchinjector_arm64
```

Then rebuild and install the APK normally (`./gradlew installDebug`).
The app copies the binary from `assets/` to its private `filesDir` at
runtime and sets `chmod +x` before first use.

---

## Binary protocol

The binary accepts commands on **stdin** and signals readiness on **stdout**.

| Line sent to stdin | Meaning                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `D <x> <y>\n`      | Finger DOWN at physical portrait coordinates (x, y) |
| `M <x> <y>\n`      | Finger MOVE to (x, y)                               |
| `U <x> <y>\n`      | Finger UP                                           |

On startup the binary writes `R\n` to stdout once the `/dev/input/event6`
file descriptor is open and ready.

### Coordinate space

`event6` (`fts_ts`) is the AYN Thor primary display touchscreen in its
**physical portrait orientation**:

- X axis: 0 … 1080 (left → right in portrait)
- Y axis: 0 … 1920 (top → bottom in portrait)

`TouchpadManager` converts normalised Compose touch coordinates to this
space:

```
sensor_x = (1 − normalizedY) * 1080
sensor_y =  normalizedX      * 1920
```

---

## Why a static binary?

Android's `/dev/input/` nodes are only writable by `root` and `shell`
(UID 2000). On the AYN Thor `event6` is `crw-rw-rw-` (world-writable),
so the shell UID that the binary runs under can open it.

The app process itself runs as `u0_a<N>` and cannot open `/dev/input/`
directly. Launching a child process via `ProcessBuilder("sh")` gives the
child the shell UID, which can. A **static** binary is used so there are
no dynamic linker path issues when running from `filesDir`.

## Device specifics (AYN Thor)

| Property                    | Value                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Input node                  | `/dev/input/event6`             |
| Driver                      | `fts_ts`                        |
| Permissions                 | `crw-rw-rw-` (no root required) |
| MT protocol                 | Type B (slot-based)             |
| Physical size               | 1080 × 1920 (portrait)          |
| Display rotation at runtime | ROTATION_270                    |

This approach is **AYN Thor-specific**. On standard Android devices
`/dev/input/` is not world-writable and the binary will fail to open
the device node.

## Key Injector (`keyinjector_arm64`)

### Source

`app/src/main/cpp/keyinjector.c`

Creates a virtual keyboard via `/dev/uinput`, then reads `KD`/`KU` commands from stdin
and writes `EV_KEY` events into the kernel input subsystem.

### Compile

Same NDK setup as above. Use the same `build_keyinjector.sh` script at the workspace root:

```bash
sh build_keyinjector.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
NDK=/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/android-ndk/29/AndroidNDK14206865.app/Contents/NDK
TOOLCHAIN=$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64

$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android35-clang \
    --sysroot=$TOOLCHAIN/sysroot \
    --target=aarch64-linux-android35 \
    -static -O2 -s \
    -o app/src/main/assets/keyinjector_arm64 \
    app/src/main/cpp/keyinjector.c
```

### Binary protocol

| Line sent to stdin | Meaning                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `KD <keycode>\n`   | Key DOWN — Linux keycode (1–254)     |
| `KU <keycode>\n`   | Key UP — Linux keycode (1–254)       |

The binary signals readiness with `R\n` on stdout once the `/dev/uinput` virtual
device is created. On stdin EOF it destroys the virtual device and exits.

### Device specifics (AYN Thor)

| Property    | Value                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Device node | `/dev/uinput`                   |
| Permissions | `crw-rw-rw-` (no root required) |
